# DerRobertPack

A general 32x32 texture pack featuring:
* an Aether portal look for the Nether dimension portal
* classic, old-fashioned textures
* coins to trade with villagers
* different looks for chests (e.g. the Lucky Block)
* high resolution water and lava.
* special language packs
* etc.

<br>

## This resource pack is still work in progress.<br>

This means it may not function as well as it supposed to be.<br>

<br>

## It is created especially for Minecraft Version 1.19.3

But it is compatible with some versions below and above,
regardless of whatever Minecraft will tell you.

<br>

## Windows installation:

```
cd %appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks

git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/ScaryMazeVignette.git
```

<br>

## Linux installation:

```
cd ~\.minecraft\resourcepacks

git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/ScaryMazeVignette.git
```

<br>

## Please note:

* If you changed the default data path of Minecraft, you need to replace the path above by your custom one.
