# DerRobertPack

## A general 32x32 texture pack featuring:

* an Aether portal look for the Nether portal
* classic, old-fashioned textures
* coins to trade with villagers
* different looks for chests (e.g. the Lucky Block)
* high resolution water and lava.
* special language packs
* etc.

<br>

## This resource pack is still work in progress.

This means it may not function as well as it supposed to be.

<br>

## It is created for Minecraft Version 1.19.3

Nethertheless, it should be compatible to some versions below and above,<br>
regardless of whatever Minecraft will tell you.

<br>

## Windows installation:

```
cd %appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks

git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/DerRobertPack.git
```

<br>

## Linux installation:

```
cd ~\.minecraft\resourcepacks

git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/DerRobertPack.git
```

<br>

## Alternative installation:

* Download the ZIP file of the master branch to your PC.
* Copy the folder inside the ZIP file into your Minecraft data folder (see above).
* **IMPORTANT:** If you just copy the ZIP file itself into your Minecraft data folder, it will **NOT** work.

<br>

## Please note:

* If you changed the default data path of Minecraft, you need to replace the path above by your custom one.
