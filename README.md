## A general 32x32 texture pack featuring:

- an Aether portal look for the Nether portal

- classic, old-fashioned textures

- coins to trade with villagers

- different looks for chests (e.g. the Lucky Block)

- high resolution water and lava

- pumpkin easter egg

- special language packs

- etc.

<br>

## This resource pack is still work in progress ...

- ... so this means it may not function as well as it is supposed to be.

<br>

## It is created for Minecraft Version 1.19.3

- Nethertheless, it should be compatible to versions below and above.

- Although Minecraft will mistakingly consider it incompatible.

<br>

## Windows installation:

```
cd %appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks

git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/DerRobertPack.git
```

<br>

## Linux installation:

```
cd ~\.minecraft\resourcepacks

git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/DerRobertPack.git
```

<br>

## Alternative installation:

- [Download the ZIP file of the master branch to your PC](https://github.com/DerRobert-28/DerRobertPack/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

- Copy the folder inside the ZIP file into your `resourcepacks` folder:

  - for Windows: `%appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks`

  - for Linux: `~\.minecraft\resourcepacks`

- **IMPORTANT:**

  - If you just copy the ZIP file itself into your `resourcepacks` folder, it will **NOT** work.
  
  - If you extract all files and copy the extracted `resourcepacks` folder, it may also **NOT** work.

<br>

## Please note:

- If you changed the default data path of Minecraft, you need to replace the path above by your custom one.
