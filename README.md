# DerRobertPack

## This resource pack is still work in progress.<br>
This means it may not function as well as it supposed to be.<br>

## It is created especially for Minecraft Version 1.19.3
But it is compatible with some versions below and above,
regardless of whatever Minecraft will tell you.

<br>

## Windows installation:

```
cd %appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks

git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/ScaryMazeVignette.git
```

<br>

## Linux installation:

```
cd ~\.minecraft\resourcepacks

git clone https://github.com/DerRobert-28/ScaryMazeVignette.git
```

<br>

## Please note:

* If you changed the default data path of Minecraft, you need to replace the path above by your custom one.
